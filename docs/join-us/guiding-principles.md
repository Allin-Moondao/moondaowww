## Innovation

Space exploration should unify the world, not pit us against each other like the last space race. After all, aren't we all curious earthlings who want to explore the unknown? Web 3.0 represents a technology that can help unify Earth, decentralize space exploration, and even place a MoonDAO colony on the moon. This is one small step for ordinary people, but one giant leap for mankind's exploration of space.

## Community

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. We believe that our community is our greatest asset. Astronauts, ground control, and all other roles are equally important in fulfilling our mission.

## Fairness

The core team does not reserve any tokens. We don't give "special terms" to any VCs, influencers, angel investors, friends or family of rich people, or anyone else. All people should be treated equally and share the right to space exploration fairly.
