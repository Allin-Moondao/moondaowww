## What is MoonDAO?

MoonDAO is an international organization whose mission is to decentralize space research and exploration. Our first major goal is to send some of our members to space in 2022.

We are now in an era where the world is turning to a private space race. This will determine the future direction of human destiny. Enabling humanity to live on other planets in the future is one of the most inspiring and important tasks of our lives. We believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization will accomplish this great vision.

We don't want to just ride someone else's rocket, we want to fund and coordinate our own programs. We think an international collective can move much faster than any red tape organization. We can even outsource certain aspects of rocket development to private companies -- just like NASA does.


[The Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty) forms the basis of all laws concerning space. In the treaty, it is stipulated that no country can take possession of the Moon. However, a DAO is not a country - it is an international group or people that have come together around a shared mission.

As we extend the rights and freedoms of every person on Earth into the solar system, we have the opportunity to use these new tools of governance and coordination to form a more perfect union.

## MoonDAO's values

We uphold the values of inclusion, peace, transparency, organization and freedom of expression. Space should be in the hands of the people, not any state or private entity. Accordingly, MoonDAO will fund individual access to space and future space research and exploration, because that's **our mission**.

Notably, The core team does not reserve any tokens for ourselves. We don't give "special terms" to any VCs, influencers, angel investors, friends or family of rich people, or anyone else. All people should be treated equally.
