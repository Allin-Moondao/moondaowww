## What are projects?

Projects can be initiated by guilds or a specific person. Projects are autonomous in order to move things forward more efficiently and can apply funds more clearly and apparently.

## Workflow

1. Projects are proposed by a **Moon Settler**, **Voyager**, or **Astronaut** to the community.
2. A channel is created for the project to get started and come up with  clear goals, a timeline, leaders, and a budget. Whoever has the idea can bring in anyone they want into that project.
3. If a budget is needed, a Snapshot vote will be taken. Budgets are not to "pay" the contributors, but simply to cover the expenses of the project. Payment for contributors will still be done in one big Coordinape pay cycle.
4. A multi-sig wallet will be created for each project that needs a budget. This wallet will include five people on that project (including **Astronauts**) with a 3/5 signer limit.
5. All expenses will be tracked and then reported up to the DAO to ensure that all payments are in the spirit of the project. Any abuse of MoonDAO funds will result in removal from the DAO.
