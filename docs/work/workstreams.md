We've organized all the work at MoonDAO into separate workstreams (guilds or projects). Each workstream has a team of Moon Settlers and is led by Rocketeers.

In order to get started, you can find the workstream you're most suited to help with and contact the Rocketeer leading that workstream
Not every workstream will be ready to take on new people, but when they are ready they can ping you (and interview you). If the Rocketeer decides to put you on their team, they will give you the Moon Settler role.

Alternatively, if that workstream has set up a bounty board, you can permissionlessly start doing any task off of the bounty board, and get paid for doing that bounty!
