We have a very flat hierarchy at MoonDAO, there are only three roles: **Astronauts**, **Voyagers**, **Rocketeers**, and **Moon Settlers**.

## Moon Settlers
**Moon Settlers** are members of our community that have contributed positively during a pay cycle. They are anyone that have done a task from one of the Rocketeers, or have contributed a task that MoonDAO has found valuable (as decided by the Rocketeers and Astronauts). MoonSettlers come and go, and if they are no longer contributing after a pay cycle then their role is sun-setted to keep things fresh (they can always come back later with a new contribution).

## Rocketeers
Any Moon Settlers in our DAO can create a project that is officially endorsed by MoonDAO through a Snapshot vote. These proposals must follow a specific template including: timeline, goals, and budget. Once a Project is approved, a multisig will be created for that project, and those project leaders will become **Rocketeers**. Once the project is over, those Rocketeers will graduate to the Voyager role.

## Voyagers
A **Voyager** is the default role when a Rocketeer is not actively tied to an ongoing project. It is a role for people that have contributed greatly to MoonDAO to be recognized, and when a project is finished the Rocketeers in the project are moved to this role. Voyagers can always join or propose a new project to become a Rocketeer again.

## Astronauts
Astronauts Can "top down" declare workstreams as being needed and can appoint Rocketeers to lead the workstreams. Ideally workstreams are emergent and Rocketeers are placed bottom up, but in some cases some "top down" organization is needed and Astronauts can do this (these are powers to be used only in situations that need quick action).
