## What are guilds？

Guilds are the central force that drives MoonDAO to achieve its goal of landing on the moon. Community members can choose the appropriate working group to voluntarily join according to their own experience, background, and professional skills.

## Current guilds
Each of our guilds has a corresponding channel in our Discord.

**🌿 community-guild** includes writers and community design.

**💻 builders-guild** includes web development, smart contract development, and other and product development.

**📱 media-guild** includes design, marketing, and video production.
